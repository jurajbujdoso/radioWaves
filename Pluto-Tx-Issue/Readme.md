# Adalm-pluto Transmit issue, intermintment TX

![Sdr console](dash.png)

As you can see on the picuture there are intermintment trasmit problems, when using usb network card. The issue does not reocure on usb interface.
Changing one stupid switch for other one, does not resolve the situation. 
After enabling flow-control on the switch, issue gone.

Please consult your sdr console log to check networking problems.

As well I recommend to update to 1G card, but issue was resolved also on 100mBit card as well.
