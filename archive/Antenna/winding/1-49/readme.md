1:49 UNUN using two stacked FT240-43 cores for end fed halfwave antenna
In order to match the end fed half wave antenna to the coaxial feeder, it is necessary to have a matching network or transmission line transformer. The coaxial feeder is likely to be 50Ω and the antenna impedance is possibly around 4000 or 5000Ω, the impedance needs to be matched. Often a transformer is used to perform this match. As it matches an unbalanced load to an unbalanced load, these transformers are often referred to as “ununs” as opposed to the more familiar balun that matches a balanced to unbalanced line.
